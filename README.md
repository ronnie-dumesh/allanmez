# allanmez
A website for my architect friend Allan Mezhibovsky.

The project made use of several important web design principles to cater to the requests of the client and needs of the user.
This includes web accessibility. 
A minimalist design was used to better highlight the imagery and the website is compatible on both desktop and mobile devices. 
Javascript was used for both automatic and manual slideshows.

The website is accessible at https://ronnie-dumesh.github.io/allanmez/

This project was made in collaboration with Brenna Garcia and Emily Chan.
